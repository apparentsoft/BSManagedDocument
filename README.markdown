# BSManagedDocument

  A document class that mimics `UIManagedDocument` to support Core Data in all its modern glory, and more:

  *   Saves to a file package

  *   On 10.7+, asynchronous saving is supported. We set up a parent/child pair of contexts; the parent saves on its own thread

  *   Full support for concurrent document opening too

  *   Subclasses can hook in to manage additional content inside the package

  *   A hook is also provided at the best time to set metadata for the store

  *   New docs have the bundle bit set on them. It means that if the doc gets transferred to a Mac without your app installed, with the bundle bit still intact, it will still appear in the Finder as a file package rather than a folder

  *   If the document moves on disk, Core Data is kept informed of the new location

  *   If multiple validation errors occur during saving, the presented error is adjusted to make debugging a little easier
  
  *   Subclasses may specify a custom undo manager class instead of NSUndoManager, or nil undo manager.

  *   And of course, full support for Autosave-In-Place and Versions
